#### Trivia Game
1. Game consists of ten questions pertaining to the geography of the state of Utah
2. Each Question has 4 possible answers and also has 2 images specific to the question
3. Used the Bootstrap Grid-system, and also a Jumbotron and two Bootstrap buttons, then custom CSS styled the rest
4. Utilized JQuery library for selecting and Manipulating the DOM
5. Game Makes use of a Timer made with setInterval for each question to be answered within, also a setTimeout is used between questions

#### Notes
* Used a series of photos from the internet about half from my personal facebook account, all question content is from personal knowledge and research.
* Continued to make use of a series of Arrays rather than Objects, would like to include more objects in future projects, but feels more natural to use arrays and for loops to acheive game functions currently.
